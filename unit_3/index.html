	<p id="slogan"> Talking to interesting people about that interesting thing that interests them</p>

	<p id="blurb">Dan Debuf (Dan and Maz, The Bachelor Unpacked, Lords of Luxury) has realised that creative and interesting people have creative and interested brains that are easily obsessed. They're dying to talk about their latest or lifelong obsessions, if only someone would ask... well, he's asking.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Something they love but havenâ€™t had the chance to talk about publicly</li>
		<li>An aspect of what they already talk about publicly, but more specific or a deep dive</li>
		<li>A secret hobby</li>
		<li>Something they did as a kid and still revisit from time to time</li>
		<li>Something they love reading about</li>
		<li>Basically... anything they feel deserves half an hour of airtime!</li>
	</ul>
